Big O Notation:
It is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's runtime or space requirements in terms of the size of the input data. 

Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios for Search Operations:

1. Linear Search:

    Best Case: O(1) - The element is found at the first position.
    Average Case: O(n) - The element is found somewhere in the middle or not at all, requiring a search through half the elements on average.
    Worst Case: O(n) - The element is found at the last position or not found at all, requiring a search through all elements.

2. Binary Search:

    Best Case: O(1) - The element is found at the middle of the array on the first try.
    Average Case: O(log n) - The element is found after several iterations, where each iteration halves the search space.
    Worst Case: O(log n) - The element is found after searching through all possible halvings of the array.

Time Complexity Comparison:

1. Linear Search:
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Each element is checked one by one until the target element is found or the array ends.

2. Binary Search:
    Time Complexity: O(log n)
    The array is repeatedly divided in half, reducing the search space exponentially until the target element is found or the search space is empty.

Choosing the Suitable Algorithm:

    1. If data is mostly static: If the dataset is large and does not change frequently, binary search is more suitable due to its O(log n) efficiency.

    2. If data is frequently updated: Linear search might be more practical if the dataset is small to moderate in size, or if sorting the array every time an insertion or deletion occurs is not feasible.
