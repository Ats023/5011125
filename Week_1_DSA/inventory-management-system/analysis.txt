Why Data Structures and Algorithms Are Essential in Handling Large Inventories:

Data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories because they enable efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data. They help optimize the performance of operations such as adding, updating, and deleting products, which is crucial for maintaining a responsive system as the inventory size grows.

Types of Data Structures Suitable for This Problem:

1. HashMap: Provides average O(1) time complexity for add, update, and delete operations due to direct access via hashing.

2. ArrayList: Suitable for smaller datasets or when the order of insertion is important but has greater time complexity for search operations.

Time Complexity Analysis

Add: O(1) - Inserting a new product involves computing a hash and placing the product in the appropriate bucket.
Update: O(1) - Updating involves retrieving the product by its key and modifying its attributes.
Delete: O(1) - Deleting involves finding the product by its key and removing it from the map.

Optimization:
1. Ensuring a good hash function reduces the number of collisions and maintains O(1) performance.
2. For more complex queries, we can consider additional indexing structures.
